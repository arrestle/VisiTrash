<h2>VisiTrash was conceived on February 1-3rd of 2019 as a weekend Make-A-Thon project. Our mission was to reduce waste on an island resort by engaging with the public during the disposal of their waste in specially designed trash receptacles.</h2>
<h2>Big Problem - We live on a small planet that is drowning in waste and pollution, at the same time climate change is displacing people and animals. What can we as students do to protect our environment?</h2>
<h2>Vision - Reducing the amount of single use packaging and food waste is a simple and effective way to help protect wildlife and divert extra food to hungry people. Engaging a large number of people at the time and place where they are throwing away waste is an efficient way to educate and change behavior one interaction at a time.</h2>
<h2>Why now - Awareness of global warming, ocean plastic pollution and mass extinctions is growing worldwide as our window to contain the damage shrinks daily.</h2>
<h2>Why us - Only a small, Agile, multi-disciplinary team focused on quickly delivering a financially viable, end to end solution can hope to succeed in this technologically and socially challenging space.</h2>
