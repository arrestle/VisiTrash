Introduction
Mission Statement - VisiTrash was concieved on February 1-3rd of 2019 as a weekend Make-A-Thon project
Our mission was to reduce waste on an island resort by engaging with the public during the disposal of their waste 
in specially designed trash recepticles.

Big Problem - We live on a small blue planet that is drowning in waste and pollution. At the same time climate change
is starting to cause mass migrations and hungry people. What can we as individuals do to protect our environment, reduce 
our dependence on single use packaging and feed hungry people?
