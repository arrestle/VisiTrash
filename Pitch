Introduction & Mission Statement - VisiTrash was concieved on February 1-3rd of 2019 as a weekend Make-A-Thon project Our mission was to reduce waste on an island resort by engaging with the public during the disposal of their waste  in specially designed trash recepticles.

Big Problem - We live on a small blue planet that is drowning in waste and pollution. At the same time climate change is displacing people and animals. What can we as students do to protect our environment, reduce our dependence on the single use packaging, protect wildlife and feed hungry people?

Vision - Start with available resources at NCSU and forge partnerships with existing content developers (National Geographic, Smithsonian, etc...)

Why now - Awareness of global warming, ocean plastic pollution and mass extinctions is growing worldwide as our window to contain the damage shrinks daily.

Why us - Only a small, Agile, multi-disciplinary team focused on quickly delivering a financially viable, end to end solution can hope to succeed in this technologically and socially challenging space.
