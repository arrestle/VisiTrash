<b>Introduction & Mission Statement</b> - VisiTrash was conceived on February 1-3rd of 2019 as a weekend Make-A-Thon project. Our mission was to reduce waste on an island resort by engaging with the public with visual rhetoric via the use of interactive designed trash receptacles. 
<br><br>
<b>Big Problem</b> - We live on a small planet that is drowning in waste and pollution, at the same time climate change is displacing people and animals. How can we as students do to protect our environment and help divert wasted food to those that need it most?
<br><br>
<b>The Vision</b> - Reducing the amount of single use packaging and food waste is a simple and effective way to help protect wildlife and divert extra food to hungry people. Engaging a large number of people at the time and place where they are throwing away waste is an efficient way to educate and change behavior one interaction at a time. Multiple Portals will be needed: 

<table class="alignleft">
	<tr> <th>Portal Name</th> <th> </th> </tr>
	<tr><th>Consumer: </th> <th>Engagement portal to educate and motivate consumers on how and why to reduce waste.</th> </tr>
	<tr> <th>Logistics: </th> <th>Route workers efficiently to keep receptacles from overflowing.</th> </tr>
	<tr><th>Management: <th>Dashboard to manage content, analyze IOT measurements, calculate ROI (Return on Investment), analyze and then tailor consumer engagements to maximize impact.</th> </tr>
</table>

<br><br>
<b>Why now</b> - Awareness of global warming, ocean plastic pollution and mass extinctions is growing worldwide as our window to contain the damage shrinks daily.
<br><br>
<b>Why us</b> - Only a small, Agile, multi-disciplinary team focused on quickly delivering a financially viable, end to end solution can hope to succeed in this technologically and socially challenging space.
